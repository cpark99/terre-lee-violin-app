        Private lessons are weekly throughout the session. In weekly lessons, we learn violin
        technique, beautiful tone production, rhythm, sight reading, prepared reading, and
        building/maintaining a repertoire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the child's age and ability, lessons start at 30 minutes, then build to 1 hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is required there is a consistent parent or adult who is part of the childâ€™s lessons and
        practice at home. This parent or adult is expected to take notes with guidance of the
        teacher so they can help shape a home practice for their child.

        An essential part of effective learning, group classes are in addition to private violin
        lessons. Group classes provide a wonderful opportunity to motivate students. In these
        classes, students will review music vocabulary, refine techniques, work and play together as
        an ensemble, develop leadership skills, and have a good time!
      </p>
      <p>
        Group class gives students a peer group during their musical journey with other musical
        friends to play and improve with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Group class is a requirement to take lessons at Terre's studio. Class is every other
        Wednesdays at 4:30.
